## DS_MATPLOTLIB

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the basics of data visualization using Matplotlib.  
It includes examples of line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and customization techniques.  
This is part of my Data Science learning journey using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
